### What is 3in1 stands for.  

3-in-1 means there are three chipsets on a single board: ESP32, nRF24, and CC1101.

### What does 3in1 Wifi Board use for.

The board is designed for the Flipper Zero and extending Flipper functionality, including Wi-Fi, RF 2.4GHz support, and an expanded SubGHz coverage


### Specification

- ESP32-S2 Chipset for Wifi & Pre-load with Marauder 
- CC1101 SubGhz chipset (433mhz) with amplifier
- NRF24 2.4Ghz Chipset 
- 1.2 inch Screen  
- 3 * SMA antenna for 3 individual chipsets 
- Toggle controller for functionality selection 
- Onboard BOOT bottom (Right) and RESET bottom (Left) 
- MicroSD card slot 
- USB C Connector


  
### How the board operate 

- Simply plug in the board to the Flipper Zero, use the toggle to select one of the three chipsets, choose the app via the Flipper, and youâ€™re good to go.
- nRF24 and CC1101 chipsets don't require firmware to work. Most of Flipper Zero firmware, including Momentum, Unleashed, etc would support both natively.
- ESP32-32 requires Marauder firmware to perform, which has been pre-loaded. 

### CC1101 Amplifier Explanation

The switch at the back of the board is for the SubGHz CC1101 amplifier. (The switch can be accessed by disassembling the 3D-printed case.)
- When the switch is set to **TX**, it **amplifies the transmitting signal** of the Sub chipset. 
- When the switch is set to **RX**, it **amplifies the receiving signal** of the CC1101 chipset. 
- Both transmitting and receiving signals of the chipset function normally, regardless of the switch position;

### How to upgrade Marauder firmware

To flash the Marauder onto the board, we suggest using **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**.  

There are two buttons located near the screen: the button on the right is the Boot button, and the one on the left is the Reset button. 

1. Open the Web Flasher called < ESPWebTool > [https://esp.huhn.me/](https://esp.huhn.me/). 

2. Connect the USB-C cable to your laptop or computer. Then, while **holding the BOOT button** (on the right side of the board), plug the USB-C cable into the board. AKA, getting the board into Bootloader mode rather than starting up normally

3. Then, click "Connect" on the website.

4. In the prompt window, select <ESP32-S2 (COM X)> (X will be a number between 1 and 9). 

5. Open [Marauder firmware website](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/update-firmware#using-spacehuhn-web-updater), and download the **four** related files under **Flipper Zero WiFi Dev Board**, as the 3-in-1 board uses the same chipset as the original Flipper WiFi Dev Board, as showed in the following picture. 

6. Next, load up the files into the ESPWebTool as shown in the picture. After double-checking that you've selected the correct files, click "PROGRAM."

7. The system should be ready to go in a few minutes.

FYI. Some people might need a few attempts to get it working during the process of getting the board into Bootloader mode, aka holding the BOOT button and connecting the USB-C cable, and the web refresher recogize it. Just be patient and try a few times.

### Warrenty and Tech Support

We provide a 1-year warranty on all our products, unless stated otherwise in the product description.

FYI, our Etsy shop is no longer in operation. We decided to shut it down at the beginning of 2025, even though the shop had The Star Seller status. We estimate that we spent at least 25% of our time just communicating with Etsy's seller management team for unproductive nonsense, including having our shop shut down twice without warning, with no valid reasons provided after the shop was restored, along with several other BS that had nothing to do with the products and services we offer.

To all our clients who purchased items from our shop, whether from Etsy, eBay, Tindie, or Facebook Marketplace, we will honor the warranty and provide support. Please feel free to email us at Support@honeyhoneylab.com.
